  9. [ ] Write a Java program to test that a given array of integers of length 2 contains a 4 or a 7. Original Array: [5, 7]  Sample Output: true
  10. [ ] Write a Java program to rotate an array (length 3) of integers in left direction. Sample Output: Original Array: [20, 30, 40] Rotated Array: [30, 40, 20]
  11. [ ] Write a Java program to get the larger value between first and last element of an array (length 3) of integers. Sample Output: Original Array: [20, 30, 40] Larger value between first and last element: 40

  19. [ ] Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in multidimensional arrays and looping constructs. Eg., If there are 4 batches in BTech - “CSE1007” course, read the count of the slow learners (who have scored <25) in each batch. Tutors should be assigned in the ratio of 1:4 (For every 4 slow learners, there should be one tutor). Determine the number of tutors for each batch. Create a 2-D jagged array with 4 rows to store the count of slow learners in the 4 batches. The number of columns in each row should be equal to the number of groups formed for that particular batch ( Eg., If there are 23 slow learners in a batch, then there should be 6 tutors and in the jagged array, the corresponding row should store 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,3). Use for-each loop to traverse the array and print the details. Also print the number of batches in which all tutors have exactly 4 students.
