6. [ ] Write a Java program to test if the first and the last element of an array of integers are same. The length of the array must be greater than or equal to 2.
       Test Data:
       array = 50, -20, 0, 30, 40, 60, 10

  9. [ ] Write a Java program to test that a given array of integers of length 2 contains a 4 or a 7. Original Array: [5, 7]  Sample Output: true
  10. [ ] Write a Java program to rotate an array (length 3) of integers in left direction. Sample Output: Original Array: [20, 30, 40] Rotated Array: [30, 40, 20]
  11. [ ] Write a Java program to get the larger value between first and last element of an array (length 3) of integers. Sample Output: Original Array: [20, 30, 40] Larger value between first and last element: 40

  19. [ ] Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in multidimensional arrays and looping constructs. Eg., If there are 4 batches in BTech - “CSE1007” course, read the count of the slow learners (who have scored <25) in each batch. Tutors should be assigned in the ratio of 1:4 (For every 4 slow learners, there should be one tutor). Determine the number of tutors for each batch. Create a 2-D jagged array with 4 rows to store the count of slow learners in the 4 batches. The number of columns in each row should be equal to the number of groups formed for that particular batch ( Eg., If there are 23 slow learners in a batch, then there should be 6 tutors and in the jagged array, the corresponding row should store 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,3). Use for-each loop to traverse the array and print the details. Also print the number of batches in which all tutors have exactly 4 students.
